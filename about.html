                        <p>
                            Born from paint-stained hands, torch burns, many slivers, and the hum of too many creative
                            experiments at once,
                            <em>The Jack</em> is not just a name, it's a manifesto. Aiden Beard is a self-taught,
                            detail-driven artist who builds beautiful things from whatever's available. With hands that
                            have touched everything from glass to graphite to epoxy and digital design, Aiden’s practice
                            is defined by experimentation, resilience, and raw creativity.
                            Aiden Beard is a multidisciplinary artist and designer pursuing a degree in Media Arts and
                            Sciences with a focus on graphic design and animation. His work spans hand-drawn pieces,
                            digital design, wood and epoxy, and custom commissions. The result is an ever-evolving
                            portfolio shaped by curiosity and the necessity to create, with a creative process that
                            often begins with what’s available and ends with something unforgettable.
                            Every project, from client commissions to personal experiments, is approached with
                            thoughtful intention and a drive for lasting impact. Aiden’s strengths lie in creative
                            problem-solving, attention to fine detail, and the ability to turn even modest materials
                            into pieces that resonate.

I don’t want to fit into one label, one medium, or one kind of work. I like having my hands in everything. I like the challenge of learning as I go. It means the work is always different and so is the process getting to the final result. It means if I haven’t done it yet, I probably will soon. I create from instinct, impulse, and whatever I can get my hands on. Every piece is a mix of chaos, control, and creative adventure. If it doesn’t make you feel something, it’s not finished.</p>";
